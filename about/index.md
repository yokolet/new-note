## About yokolet’s notelets

Hi! Thank you for visiting my website!

This website is mostly for blog posts.
The posts here are for myself to remember things.
So, each post is nothing special. Similar ones can be found elsewhere.
Writing by my own words helps me to understand things and shape ideas better.

The update will be random. When I’m impressed by something, I write a new post.

I created this website by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[bulma-clean-theme](https://www.csrhymes.com/bulma-clean-theme/).
The website code is pushed to the repository: [new-note](https://github.com/yokolet/new-note).
Please visit the repo also!
