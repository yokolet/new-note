## Introduction
To solve string partition problems, hash table or set is used to save a previous occurrence.
If the problem asks a length, it needs hash table.
However, this problem asks just a number of groups, set is a good data structure to solve.

## Problem Description
> Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings
> such that the characters in each substring are unique.
> That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
>
> Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
>
> Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
>
> Constraints:
> - `1 <= s.length <= 10**5`
> - `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.

## Examples
```
Example 1
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a"), ("ab","a","ca","ba"), and ("ab","ac","ab","a").
```

```
Exammle 2
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
```

## Analysis
Use a set to save the previous occurrence of a same character.
If the same character appears, count up and clear the set.
In the end, if the set is not empty, count up.

## Solution
```python
class OptimalPartitionString:
    def partitionString(self, s: str) -> int:
        count, seen = 0, set()
        for c in s:
            if c in seen:
                count += 1
                seen.clear()
            seen.add(c)
        return count + 1 if seen else count
```

## Complexities
- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(n)`
