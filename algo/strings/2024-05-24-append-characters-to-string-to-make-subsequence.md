## Problem Description
> You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.
>
> Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes
> a subsequence of `s`.
>
> A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters
> without changing the order of the remaining characters.
>
> Constraints:
> - `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10**5`
> - `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Examples
```
Example 1
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```

```
Example 2
Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
```

```
Example 3
Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```

## How to Solve

The question asks the length of `t`'s postfix.
Use two pointers to identify a prefix.
One goes through `s`, another goes through `t` sequentially.
Increment `s`'s index one by one.
Only when two characters in `s` and `t` are the same, increment `t`'s index.
When the loop is over, `t`'s length minus 't`'s index is the answer.
