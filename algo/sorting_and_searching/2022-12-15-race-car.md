## Problem Description
> Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions.
> Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):
> - When you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:
>     - `position += speed`
>     - `speed *= 2`
> - When you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:
>     - If your speed is positive then `speed = -1`
>     - otherwise `speed = 1`
>     - Your position stays the same.
>
> For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions `0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3`, and your speed goes to
> `1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1`.
>
> Given a target position `target`, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.
>
> Constraints:
> - `1 <= target <= 10**4`
>

## Examples
```
Exmaple 1
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.
```

```
Example 2
Input: target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
```

## How to Solve
For this problem, a couple of approaches are there: dynamic programming, breadth-first search, or priority queue (heap).
Among those, the solution here took the breadth-first search approach.
It is a relatively simple solution.
In the queue, the solution saves position and speed pairs.
When the race car goes forward, (position + speed, speed * 2) will be added to the queue as a next state.
The race car is allowed to go back.
When the speed is negative and position + speed is less than the target,
or the speed is positive and position + speed is greater than the target,
the backward move has an effect.
As the problem describes, the position stays the same.
So, (position, backward speed of -1 or 1) will be added to the queue as a next state.
