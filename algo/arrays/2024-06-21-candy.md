## Problem Description
> There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.
>
> You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
> - Each child must have at least one candy.
> - Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
>
> Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
>
> Constraints:
> - `n == ratings.length`
> - `1 <= n <= 2 * 10**4`
> - `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10**4`
> 
> [https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

## Examples
```
Example 1
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

```
Example 2
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

```

## How to Solve

This problem asks to create an array with mountains.
The common solution of this kind is a two-path enumeration.
Firstly, process an array value from left to right.
Then, process the array from right to left.
Both, if the previous index's rating is lower than current, the number of candies at the current index should be
greater than previous candies by one.
Once the two-path enumeration finishes, count total number of candies.
