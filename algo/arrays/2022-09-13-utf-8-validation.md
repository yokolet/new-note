## Introduction
Two keys are there to solve this problem:
- convert integer to binary string
- count bytes following the rule

Above two are all for this problem.

## Problem Description
> Given an integer array `data` representing the data,
> return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).
>
> A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
> - For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a `0`, followed by its Unicode code.
> - For an n-bytes character, the first `n` bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0,
>   followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
>
> This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

> ```

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
```

```
Example 2:
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
```

## Analysis
The first step is to convert a given integer to zero padded binary string.
This depends on the language. In Python, formatting is the way to convert.
The second step is to count bytes.
When the byte count is zero, following binary strings are counted up.
WHen the byte count is greater than zero and '10' byte mark exists, it counts down.
In the end, check count is zero.

## Solution
```python
class Utf8Validation:
    def validUtf8(self, data: List[int]) -> bool:
        count = 0
        for d in data:
            s = '{0:08b}'.format(d)
            if count == 0 and s.startswith('110'):
                count = 1
            elif count == 0 and s.startswith('1110'):
                count = 2
            elif count == 0 and s.startswith('11110'):
                count = 3
            elif count > 0 and s.startswith('10'):
                count -= 1
            elif count == 0 and s.startswith('0'):
                continue
            else:
                return False
        return count == 0
```

## Complexities
- Time: `O(n)`
- Space: `O(1)`
