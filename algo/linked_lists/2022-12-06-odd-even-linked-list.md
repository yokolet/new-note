## Problem Description
> Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by
> the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
>
> The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
>
> Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
>
> You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.
>
> Constraints:
> - The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 10**4].
> - `-10**6 <= Node.val <= 10**6`

## Examples
```
Example 1
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
Explanation:
input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
output: 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4
```

```
Example 2
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
Explanation:
input: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4 -> 7
output: 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4
```

## How to Solve

It's not difficult to think of the solution for this problem.
Use two pointers for odd and even indicies.
The odd pointer picks up the first node then its next of next.
The even pointer picks up the second node then its next of next.
As we do always, increment the pointers.
In the end, connect the tail of odd pointer and the head of even pointer.
The answer is the odd head pointer.
