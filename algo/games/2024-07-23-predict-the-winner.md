## Problem Description
> You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.
>
> Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0.
> At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array \
> (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1])` which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds
> the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.
>
> Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner,
> and you should also return `tru`e. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.
>
> Constraints:
> - `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
> - `0 <= nums[i] <= 10**7`
>

## Examples
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```

```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

## How to Solve

The basic idea is to think the possibility to get more score when the player 1 takes a leftmost or rightmost value.
The result depends on the values left in the array.
The recursive approach is used here to calculate the results coming from two ways: left and right.
When the leftmost value is taken, calculate the difference between the leftmost value and the result from left + 1, to right.
The same calculation is done using rightmost value. The difference will be the rightmost value and the result from left, to right -1.
The greater value is the result of the iteration.
In the end, check the score is positive or not. If it is positive, the player 1 wins.

Additionally, the solution here uses memoization to improve performance. The iteration ends earlier when the left and right
indices combination appears again.
