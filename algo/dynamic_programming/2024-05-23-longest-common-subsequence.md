## Problem Description
> Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
> If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
>
> A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some
> characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
>
> For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
> A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
>
> Constraints:
> - `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
> - `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Examples
```
Example 1
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

```
Example 2
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

```
Example 3
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

## How to Solve

This is a typical dynamic programming problem.
The easiest way is to create 2D array to save states up to indices i, j where i, j are index of
each text. If `text1[i]` is the same as `text2[j]`, the state will be `matrix[i-1][j-1]+1`.
If not the same, take the maximum of `matrix[i-1][j]` and `matrix[i][j-1]`.
The answer is in the bottom right of the matrix. For example, when "abcdef" and "acbcf" are given,
the algorithm works as in below:

```
  | -   a   b   c   d   e   f
--+--------------------------
- | 0   0   0   0   0   0   0
a | 0   1   1   1   1   1   1
c | 0   1   1   2   2   2   2
b | 0   1   2   2   2   2   2
c | 0   1   1   3   3   3   3
f | 0   1   1   3   3   3   4
```

The solution here uses two 1D auxiliary arrays instead of 2D matrix.
This is a memory performance tweak.
Allocating 1D array is much faster compared to 2D matrix even though it needs two arrays.
