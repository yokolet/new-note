# yokole's notelets

This a blog site for __yokolet's notelets__ hosted at [yokolet.com](https://yokolet.com/).
The site was written by [jekyll](jekyllrb.com) with the Cayman theme.

As of August 2019, github pages has a problem of pagination.
The github pages pulls jekyll 3 whose pagination is v2.
However, github pages gem is designed to work with older version of pagination.

After attempt many with no luck, the decision has made.
The website will have two repositories, one for jekyll project to create a website,
another for a complete static website contents.

The twin repositories for the website are:

- jekyll project: [new-note](https://github.com/yokolet/new-note)
- static wesite: [yokolet.github.io](https://github.com/yokolet/yokolet.github.com)
