Well, how bad naive implementation of generating permutation?
Permutation is a well-known problem in mathematics as well as
programming. If a set of three characters, {A, B, C}, its permutation
is:

```
ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA
```

Three characters generate six patterns, which is `3*2*1`, a factorial
of its size.


The easiest implementation is a brute-force, recursing all. How
many times will it repeat? The answer is a factorial of total number of given
characters. Crap! In terms of Big-O complexity, the factorial is the
worst. See Big-O Complexitiy Chart at
[Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).
To generate only 10 letters of permutation, 3628800 times repetition
must be done.


#### How to effectively find permutation ####

This is a famous problem, so it's easy to find the solution for "how to
effectively find/generate permutation." As far as I googled, these
three were the best.

- [Next lexicographical permutation algorithm](https://www.nayuki.io/page/next-lexicographical-permutation-algorithm)
- [Print all permutations in sorted (lexicograpic) order](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lexicographic-permutations-of-string/)
- the answer by Michal Fori≈°ek
  [How would you explain an algorithm that generates permutations using loxicographic ordering?](https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-an-algorithm-that-generates-permutations-using-lexicographic-ordering)

Overall, above three take the same approach. The trick is
*lexicographical order*. The lexicographical order is not the goal
but is the way to effectively generates permutations.
Above three *use* the lexicographical order to find next permutations
one by one. When there's no next permutation, all permutations are
generated.


#### Permutation generation code ####

Steps of the algorithm are:

1. (optional) sort given string or array
2. find longest non-increasing suffix such that `array[index] <= array[index+1]`
3. identify the pivot index such that the first `array[index] > array[index+1]`
4. find the ceil (successor), the right most index such that `array[pivot] < array[succ]`
5. swap the pivot and successor, array[pivot] and array[succ]
6. reverse the suffix from array[pivot+1] to array[array.length-1]
   if the array has been sorted at step 1, sort suffix instead of reversing

The sorted version of permutation in Java will be something like this:

{% highlight java %}
import java.util.Arrays;

public class AllPermutations {
    static void sortedPermutations(char[] array) {
        Arrays.parallelSort(array);
        boolean isFinished = false;
        int count = 0;
        while (!isFinished) {
            if (count !=0 && count % 10 == 0) System.out.println();
            System.out.print((new String(array)) + " "); count++;

            int index = array.length-2;
            // find non-increasing suffix
            while(index >= 0) {
                if (array[index] <= array[index+1]) break;
                index--;
            }
            if (index == -1) {
                isFinished = true;
            } else {
                // the pivot is array[index]
                // find the rightmost successor to the pivot in suffix
                int succ = array.length-1;
                while(array[succ] <= array[index]) succ--;
                // swap the pivot and successor
                char tmp = array[index];
                array[index] = array[succ];
                array[succ] = tmp;
                // sort suffix
                Arrays.parallelSort(array, index+1, array.length);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      sortedPermutations("ABCDE".toCharArray());
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above code prints:
